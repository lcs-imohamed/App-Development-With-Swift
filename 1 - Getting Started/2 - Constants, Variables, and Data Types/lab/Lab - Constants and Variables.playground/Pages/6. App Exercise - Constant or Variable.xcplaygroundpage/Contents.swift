/*:
 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Lisa"
print("Name is a constant because the person's name doesn't change.")
var age = 21
print("Age is a variable because age will increase after time.")
var numberSteps = 8000
print("Number of steps is a variable because it will change from day to day.")
let goalSteps = 10000
print("Step goal is a constant because it is an unchanging value and goal.")
var avgHeartRate = 70
print("Average heart rate is a variable because it changes day to day.")





/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
